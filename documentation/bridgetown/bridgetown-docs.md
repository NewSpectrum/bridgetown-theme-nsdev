# Bridgetown Docs

The `/documentation/bridgetown` directory is meant to be a more uniform, user-friendly collection of the original/built-in "documentation" that can originally be found in [file comments](#commented-notes), the [default README](#bridgetown-readme), etc.

### Commented Notes
Comments containing instructions/examples/etc from files that are generated with a new [site scaffold](#bridgetown-scaffold) are combined, clarified, and formatted for Markdown. For example...
- The `esbuild-notes.md` file contains the combined notes of:
	- `esbuild.config.js`
	- `config/esbuild.defaults.js`
-
