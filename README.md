# NewSpectrum.dev Theme
> __Warning__<br />
> This theme is still very early in its development and is __*not*__ ready for use.

> __Note__<br />
> This README is incomplete, more information coming soon.

An easy-to-use theme for [Bridgetown](https://bridgetownrb.com/). While the ultimate goal is to provide a versatile and easily-customized theme that can be used for just about anything- which will eventually be a separate theme named __NewSpectrum__, the [NSDev Bridgetown Theme](#nsdev-theme) will serve as its foundation.

This theme is specifically geared towards the following kinds of sites:
- Tech-based Websites
    - Coding/Development
        - Company Websites
        - Guides, Wikis, and other Documentation
        - Active Project Homepages/Sites
    - IT Services
        - Company Websites
        - Guides, Wikis, and other Documentation
- Blogs
    - Specifically for blogs with a tech-based focus
